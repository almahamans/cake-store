# CAKE-BAKRY
## Description
SPA for cake bakry showing the menu and options for create a unique cake/cubcake.
## Languages 
for styling I used bootstrap mainly for layout and to make it responsive to any screen size, also used jQuery library to make the web page responsive with the user for this created functions for hid/show some divs, to calculate the bill and clear.
### Thoughts
I practice my skills in making html forms and using bootstrap and jquery, I did not put all my effort in designing because I focused to apply what I learned corrcetly but I tried my best!
